OpenEmbedded BSP layer for Rockchip boards

About:
-----
	The purpose of this layer is to provide OpenEmbedded BSP support for
	Rockchip-based devices using upstream sources as much as possible.

Dependencies:
------------
	URI: git://git.openembedded.org/openembedded-core
	layers: meta
	branch: matched branches (e.g. master, sumo, ...)

	URI: git://git.yoctoproject.org/meta-arm
	layers: meta-arm, meta-arm-toolchain
	branch: matched branches (e.g. master, sumo, ...)

Status of supported boards:
--------------------------
	builds and boots wic image:
		nanopi-m4
		nanopi-m4-2gb
		rock-pi-e
		rock-pi-4a
		rock-pi-4b
		rock-pi-4c
		rock64
		tinker-board

		rock-5a
	builds:
		marsboard-rk3066
		radxarock
		rock2-square

Notes:
-----
	The latest ddr initializer for the rk3308 platform (currently only
	used by the rock-pi-s machine) does not output diagnostic messages
	to uart0. This causes a bunch of gibberish to be printed to the
	console window which only becomes legible once the linux kernel
	starts. I.e. the console output of the ddr initialization routine,
	as well as u-boot is lost. An older version of this same binary
	blob does, however, support output to uart0 (making its diagnostic
	messages as well as u-boot available on the console). By default
	the build assumes the user would like to see these message and be
	able to have the option to interact with u-boot. Iow: for the
	rock-pi-s an older version of rkbin is used.

	If, however, the user would prefer to use the latest binary ddr
	initializer from rkbin, simply set:

		RKBIN_RK3308_LATEST = "1"
	
	in the configuration (e.g. conf/local.conf).

Maintenance:
-----------
	Please send pull requests, patches, comments, or questions to the
	yocto mailing list (yocto@lists.yoctoproject.org) CCing the maintainer

	When sending patches, please make sure the email subject line includes
	"[meta-rockchip][PATCH]" and follow the community's patch submission
	guidelines, as described in:
		https://www.openembedded.org/wiki/Commit_Patch_Message_Guidelines
		https://www.openembedded.org/wiki/How_to_submit_a_patch_to_OpenEmbedded

	Please send changes to the yocto mailing list with [meta-rockchip] in the subject line,
	cc'ing the maintainer.

	This can be configured within the repository with the following commands:

		git config sendemail.to yocto@lists.yoctoproject.org
		git config sendemail.cc twoerner@gmail.com
		git config format.subjectprefix "meta-rockchip] [PATCH"

	Then, to send your most recent commit (i.e. just one patch),
	please use something like:

		git format-patch -M -1
		git send-email <your patch file>
